# Vehicle Detection and Counting with Yolo

This project uses the YOLOv10 model (you can change Yolov10 to Yolo11 or any Yolo version you want ) to detect and count different vehicle types in video footage.

## Introduction
This project uses a combination of YOLOv10 for object detection and the SORT algorithm for tracking vehicles across frames in a video. It also includes a mask to focus on a specific video region.

## Features
- Detects and tracks vehicles like cars, trucks, buses, motorbikes, and people.
- Counts vehicles crossing a specified line in the video.
- Saves the results, including vehicle counts, to a text file.
- Generates an output video with visual overlays and real-time counting.
